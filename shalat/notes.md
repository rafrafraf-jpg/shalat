# Architecture

## setup plan 1:
make my laptop a python server that my phone can connect to through a website.
this website will be an interface that allows the user to control the mouse on the laptop.

## setup plan 2:
make the server on repl. my laptop will be a client as well as my phone. they will communicate through the repl server.

benefits:
- would be easier for me to code as im familiar with coding servers on repl but not on my own computer.
drawbacks:
- might be slower than making my laptop run the server.
- repl servers go down and must restart after some time.

# GUI

## interface plan 1:
- make my phone screen a mouse track pad - mouse will follow finger movement.
- tapping the trackpad will click (similar to macbook trackpad).

## interface plan 2:
- make the phone use rotation as the mouse input. (similar to a smart tv remote)

benefits:
* 
drawbacks:
* might be harder to navigate the mouse accurately.

## interface plan 3:
- have a joystick control the mouse

benefits:
* would be able to make it resemble a tv remote better than plans 1 & 2
drawbacks:
* mouse navigation would be slower

## additional features/ideas:
- volume and brightness control from phone
- make the interface resemble a tv remote
